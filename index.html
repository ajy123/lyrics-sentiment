            >"Quantitative Sentiment Analysis of Lyrics in Popular Music"</a
          >,researchers described how the lyrics of popular music have trended
          towards a more negative tone, characterized by emotions such as anger,
          disgust, fear, sadness, and conscientiousness. <br />This analysis
          covered Billboard 100 songs from 1951 to 2016. Does this trend
          continue in recent years? <br />By examining Spotify's weekly Top 200
          playlists from 2017 to 2021, we can explore this question further. The
          chart on the right illustrates the distribution of songs across
          different emotional categories (positive, slightly positive, slightly
          negative, negative) for each week.  <br />Most pop songs' lyrics have
          fluctuated between slightly positive and slightly negative emotions
          over this period. However, a notable trend emerged in early 2020:
          listeners seemed to prefer songs with more extreme emotional content,
          likely reflecting the uncertainty and anxiety of the COVID-19
          pandemic.

          <u>Methodology and Notes </u><br />Emotional categories are determined
          by spaCy's sentiment analysis, which assigns a sentiment score between
          -1 and 1 to each song. These scores are categorized as follows:
          <ul>
          <li>Positive: scores between 0.5 and 1 </li>
          <li>Slightly Positive: scores between 0 and 0.5 </li>
          <li>Slightly Negative: scores between -0.5 and 0 </li>
          <li>Negative: scores between -1 and -0.5</li>
          </ul>
